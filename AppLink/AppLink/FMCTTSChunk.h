/**
 * Specifies what is to be spoken. This can be simply a text phrase, which SYNC will speak according to its own rules.
 *  It can also be phonemes from either the Microsoft SAPI phoneme set, or from the LHPLUS phoneme set.
 *  It can also be a pre-recorded sound in WAV format (either developer-defined, or provided by the SYNC platform).
 *
 *  <p>In SYNC, words, and therefore sentences, can be built up from phonemes and are used to explicitly provide the proper pronounciation to the TTS engine.
 *   For example, to have SYNC pronounce the word "read" as "red", rather than as when it is pronounced like "reed",
 *   the developer would use phonemes to express this desired pronounciation.
 *  <p>For more information about phonemes, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoneme">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoneme</a>.
