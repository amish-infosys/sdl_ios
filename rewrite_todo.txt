- Make stream delegate base class handle stream event open/end instead of via method overrides (using observers)
- When on legacy protocol, getting stream end event should NOT cause a reconnection attempt

- Add max retry counter (for stream open timer, ?)
- One global retry counter; reset when?
- Fix/add delays on retries

- Each block that is GCD dispatched needs to verify at the start that objects are still valid

- Remove byte-level transport logging that could slow down execution
- Revamp the logging such that all code paths/events are covered and they are self-explanatory

- Change FMCIAPSession to use FMCTimer instead of semaphore (if feasible)
