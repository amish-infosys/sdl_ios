[Hugh]
- Change timeouts to be much shorter (1-2 seconds)
- Add max retry counter (for stream open timer, ?)
- One global retry counter; reset when?
- Fix/add delays on retries


- Each block that is GCD dispatched needs to verify at the start that objects are still valid

- Remove byte-level transport logging that could slow down execution
- Revamp the logging such that all code paths/events are covered and they are self-explanatory

- Change FMCIAPSession to use FMCTimer instead of semaphore (if feasible)
